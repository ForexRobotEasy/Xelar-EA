## Description

The Xelar EA trading robot is designed to engage in high-risk forex trading scenarios using a high-risk, high-reward trading strategy. It aims to take advantage of various trading opportunities across different markets by entering multiple trades. This robot is specifically developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team to potentially yield higher returns for traders.

The code is structured to handle a risk-tolerant trading style and implements complex trading strategies. It interacts with the markets continuously, allowing users to potentially generate impressive profits. The user-friendly interface makes it easy for traders to understand and control the trading strategies implemented by Xelar EA.

## How It Works

The Xelar EA trading robot executes trades based on a predefined set of rules and parameters. Here's how it works:

1. The necessary libraries are included, and constants are defined.
2. User input parameters such as risk percentage, take profit level, stop loss level, and maximum number of trades are set.
3. The trade object is initialized.
4. The `EnterTrade` function is defined to handle the entry of trades.
5. Inside the `EnterTrade` function:
   - The lot size is calculated based on the available account balance and the user-defined risk percentage.
   - It checks if the maximum number of trades is already reached. If so, it prints a message and exits the function.
   - It checks if there is enough free margin to open the trade. If not, it prints a message and exits the function.
   - It calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the current price.
   - It opens the trade with the specified symbol, order type, lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.
6. The `OnStart` function serves as the main program entry point.
7. Inside the `OnStart` function, trades are entered for different markets using the `EnterTrade` function.
8. The code executes the trading strategy and interacts with the markets based on the predefined rules and parameters.

Please note that this is a simplified explanation of the code's functionality. The actual code may have additional features, error handling, and optimizations.
